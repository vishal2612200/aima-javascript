				<h1>Edge Detection</h1>

				<p>
					For many of us, it is easy to find both the objects in a picture and their boundaries. Humans are
					very good at identifying what something is and where it is given a clear line of sight, but what if
					we need to find the boundaries of many objects in an enormously large number photos? This is too
					much work for one person. Why don't we just make a computer find the edges for us instead?
					In computer vision, this is a general problem known as <strong>edge detection</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Formally, edge detection is the process of detecting the boundaries in an image that separate great
					changes in brightness or <strong>intensity</strong>. One of the reasons for doing edge detection is
					that it is able to reduce a complex image down to a simpler one where only edges are marked.
					Because of this, edge detection often acts as a preliminary step to other computer vision processes.
				</p>

				<div id="pipeline2d-direct-root"></div>

				<h2>Image Representation</h2>

				<p>
					Before jumping into edge detection, let's go over how computers represent images. Computers
					generally store images as grids of values or <strong>pixel arrays</strong>. A color image, for
					instance, is decomposable into three pixel arrays storing the RGB color channels. While RGB is
					convenient for representing color, edge detection is only interested in looking at intensity values.
					Fortunately for us, it is possible to directly compute intensity from RGB values, giving us a pixel
					array of grayscale intensities to start working with.
				</p>

				<div id="rgb-root"></div>

				<div class="blurb-container">
					<h4><strong>From RGB to Intensity</strong></h4>
					<p>
						The conversion from RGB to intensity is a somewhat involved process that delves into color
						science and human perception. While RGB is a helpful model, in reality, humans do not perceive
						color linearly or equally among the three channels. To convert RGB to intensity, each RGB value
						must first be mapped into a linear color space. These values are then put through a weighted sum
						and converted back to our non-linear RGB color space for display.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Finding Edges</h2>

				<p>
					How do we begin searching for edges? We need some natural intuition for what an edge is.
					To aid us in this question, let us take a step back and re-imagine our problem.
					Suppose our pixel array is put into 3D space as a topological map where the intensity of
					each pixel becomes some height. Looking at the example below, it becomes clear that edges are
					analogous to sharp drops and inclines on this map.
				</p>

				<div id="topology-root"></div>

				<p>
					How do we locate areas with these sharp changes in height? Let's pick some point on this map.
					Knowing our point’s height alone is relatively unhelpful since although it may tell us how
					high up it is, we get no information about how the height has changed around it. What if, in
					addition, we also considered the heights of points a small radius away from our chosen point?
					Ah-hah! Now by comparing these nearby heights, we can get some measurement of the height changes
					around our point!
				</p>

				<img src="./images/elevation.png" alt="Elevation comparison example" class="center display-image">

				<p>
					This intuition is the driving principle behind a well-known edge detector called the <strong>Sobel
						operator</strong>. The operator works by dragging two <strong>kernels</strong> or
					<strong>filters</strong> called Sobel X and Sobel Y across an image to calculate horizontal and
					vertical intensity changes respectively. For each target pixel in the image, the kernel selects and
					performs an operation on a neighborhood of surrounding pixels. This compares the intensity of the
					neighboring pixels with each other and uses them to compute the change in intensity at the target
					pixel. To demonstrate this, below is an interactive example using the Sobel X
					and Sobel Y filters. Drag the filters around and see how different areas reflect different
					intensity changes.
				</p>

				<div id="convolution-root"></div>

				<div class="blurb-container">
					<h4><strong>The Math Behind the Filter</strong></h4>
					<p>
						Under the hood, filters are grids of numerical weights that are matched up to each neighborhood
						of pixels. The filter weights and the pixel intensities are used to calculate a weighted sum
						that represents the change at each target pixel. This process of dragging a grid across
						a larger grid is called <strong>cross correlation</strong>. Doing this with a flipped filter is
						a slightly different process called <strong>convolution</strong>. In general, we prefer doing
						convolutions because of their nicer properties, such as being able to
						compose a series of convolutions into a single convolution.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Change as a Vector</h2>

				<p>
					The end result of applying both the Sobel X and Sobel Y filters to our image is two new pixel arrays
					containing values that represent horizontal and vertical changes respectively. These values can also
					be thought of as the X and Y components for a grid of 2D arrows or <strong>vectors</strong>.
					The vectors gotten using the Sobel operator are known as <strong>gradients</strong>. For a given
					pixel, the magnitude of the gradient tells us how much overall intensity change occurs at that pixel
					and the angle tells us the general direction of that intensity change.
				</p>

				<p>
					Below is a demonstration that illustrates these gradients. Draw edges or select one of the preset
					images and observe how the direction and magnitude of the gradient vectors change in response.
				</p>

				<div id="gradient-root"></div>

				<p>
					So far, our algorithm consists of taking a color image, converting it to grayscale intensities,
					and applying the Sobel operator to it to find the image's gradients. Observing the magnitudes
					of these gradients at the end of the pipeline below, we can already begin to see edges manifest
					as brighter pixels where intensity change is strong.
				</p>

				<div id="pipeline2d-short-root"></div>

				<h2>Problems and Shortcomings</h2>

				<p>
					Plugging images through this algorithm, you may have already noticed that Sobel by itself
					does not perform very well. Our edge detection is not very good at producing clean and precise
					edges, nor is it very good at dealing with grainy images.
				</p>

				<div id="pipeline2d-grainy-root"></div>

				<p>
					To make edge detection robust, several pre and post-processing steps are required along with Sobel.
					In fact, our current algorithm with these additional steps was formulated in 1986 by John Canny and
					is what we know as <strong>Canny edge detection</strong>. The full Canny edge detection
					pipeline can be seen below.
				</p>

				<div id="pipeline2d-long-root"></div>

				<p>
					Since the advent of Canny edge detection, many more methods of edge detection have been
					proposed and experimented with such as second-differential approaches to looking at intensity
					or physics-based approaches to name a few.
				</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>
					Edge detection is the problem of locating the boundaries among objects in a scene. The core
					principle behind locating edges is to look for areas of sharp intensity change which can be achieved
					with the Sobel operator. While this is a start to finding edges, there are many more steps involved
					in producing clean and reliable edges. The culmination of these steps is an early edge detection
					algorithm called Canny edge detection which still remains in popular use today.
